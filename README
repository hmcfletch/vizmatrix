To generate a random file use the following command:

>> ruby VizMatrixHTMLGen.rb > vizmatrix.html

There are some things in the VizMatrixHTMLGen.rb that are configureable:

x,y => size of the matrix
threshold => fraction of entries that are nonzero
cellsize => size of the individual cells, in pixels

TODO

* Textarea that accepts an smat file and converts it to the requireed json
* Process label files
